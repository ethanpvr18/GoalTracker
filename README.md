# GoalTracker
Goal Tracker is a Web App where you can enter goals you want to accomplish.  Then you can enter goal logs to keep track of your progress until you reach your goal.  Goal Tracker is unlike any other goal tracker app because you can have more control over your goal.  Meaning you can see a cumulative score of your progress on ever goal you make.
